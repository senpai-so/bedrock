# Bedrock
An extended version of [CW712 Base](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/tree/main/contracts/cw721-base). This version removes the dependency on a singular controlled (minter) and allows for further customization. This allows for more dynamic use of NFTs. This readme will be updated with documentation of extended features and a roadmap that aligns with [Bedrock](https://github.com/senpai-so/bedrock).

## Tests
Tests can be found at [`contracts/bedrock-base/src/test.rs`](contracts/bedrock-base/src/test.rs)

### Running tests
