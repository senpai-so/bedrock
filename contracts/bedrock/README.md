# Bedrock
An extended version of [CW712 Base](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/tree/main/contracts/cw721-base). This version removes the dependency on a singular controlled (minter) and allows for further customization. This allows for more dynamic use of NFTs. This readme will be updated with documentation of extended features and a roadmap that aligns with [Bedrock](https://github.com/senpai-so/bedrock).
