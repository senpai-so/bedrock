A utility to fetch or build patched Node binaries used by [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) to generate executables. This repo hosts prebuilt binaries in [Releases](https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch/releases).

## Binary Compatibility

## Security

We do not expect this project to have vulnerabilities of its own. Nonetheless, as this project distributes prebuilt Node.js binaries,

**Node.js security vulnerabilities affect binaries distributed by this project, as well.**

Like most of you, this project does not have access to advance/private disclosures of Node.js security vulnerabilities. We can only closely monitor the **public** security advisories from the Node.js team. It takes time to build and release a new set of binaries, once a new Node.js version has been released.

We aim to complete the full cycle within a day, when there is a security update. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch/issues/new) if there is no action for a while.

**It is possible for this project to fall victim to a supply chain attack.**

This project deploys multiple defense measures to ensure that the safe binaries are delivered to users:

- Binaries are compiled by [Github Actions](https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch/actions)
  - Workflows and build logs are transparent and auditable.
  - Artifacts are the source of truth. Even repository/organization administrators can't tamper them.
- Hashes of binaries are hardcoded in [source](https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch/blob/HEAD/lib/expected.ts)
  - Origins of the binaries are documented.
  - Changes to the binaries are logged by VCS (Git) and are publicly visible.
  - `pkg-fetch` rejects the binary if it does not match the hardcoded hash.
- GPG-signed hashes are available in [Releases](https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch/releases)
  - Easy to spot a compromise.
- `pkg-fetch` package on npm is strictly permission-controlled
  - Only authorized Vercel employees can push new revisions to npm.

Report to [security@vercel.com](mailto:security@vercel.com), if you noticed a disparity between (hashes of) binaries.
