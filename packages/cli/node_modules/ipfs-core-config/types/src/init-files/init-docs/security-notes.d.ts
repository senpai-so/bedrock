This distribution is meant to be an\nalpha preview, don't use it for anything mission critical.\n\nPlease note the following:\n\n- This is alpha software and has not been audited. It is our goal\n  to conduct a proper security audit once we close in on a 1.0 release.\n\n- ipfs is a networked program, and may have serious undiscovered\n  vulnerabilities. It is written in Go, and we do not execute any\n  user provided data. But please point any problems out to us in a\n  github issue, or email security@ipfs.io privately.\n\n- security@ipfs.io GPG key:\n  - 4B9665FB 92636D17 7C7A86D3 50AAE8A9 59B13AF3\n  - https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x50AAE8A959B13AF3\n\n- ipfs uses encryption for all communication, but it's NOT PROVEN SECURE\n  YET!  It may be totally broken. For now, the code is included to make\n  sure we benchmark our operations with encryption in mind. In the future,\n  there will be an \"unsafe\" mode for high performance intranet apps.\n  If this is a blocking feature for you, please contact us.\n";
